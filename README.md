# Java-Interview-Questions

## When a class implements two interfaces that have the same default method, Java does not know which method to use, and it results in a compilation error unless the class provides its own implementation.

Example Scenario

```java
interface A {
    default void show() {
        System.out.println("A's show method");
    }
}

interface B {
    default void show() {
        System.out.println("B's show method");
    }
}

class MyClass implements A, B {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyClass obj = new MyClass();
        obj.show();  // Compilation Error if not overridden
    }
}```
Compilation Error:
Duplicate default methods named show with the parameters () are inherited from the types A and B.

How to Resolve This Conflict? To resolve the ambiguity, we must override the conflicting method in MyClass and explicitly specify which interface's method to call using InterfaceName.super.methodName().

```class MyClass implements A, B {
    @Override
    public void show() {
        // Explicitly calling interface method
        A.super.show();  // Calls A's default method
        // B.super.show(); // If we want to call B's method instead
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyClass obj = new MyClass();
        obj.show();  // Prints: A's show method
    }
}
```
## @Transactional Annotation in Spring Boot

The @Transactional annotation in Spring Boot is used to manage database transactions. It ensures that a series of database operations are executed as a single unit of workâ€”either all succeed or all fail (rollback in case of an error).

```java
@Transactional(propagation = Propagation.REQUIRES_NEW)
public void someMethod() {
    // Your code here
}
