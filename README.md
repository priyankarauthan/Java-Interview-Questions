## Java-Interview-Questions

When a class implements two interfaces that have the same default method, Java does not know which method to use, and it results in a compilation error unless the class provides its own implementation.

Example Scenario

```java
interface A {
    default void show() {
        System.out.println("A's show method");
    }
}

interface B {
    default void show() {
        System.out.println("B's show method");
    }
}

class MyClass implements A, B {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyClass obj = new MyClass();
        obj.show();  // Compilation Error if not overridden
    }
}
```
Compilation Error:
Duplicate default methods named show with the parameters () are inherited from the types A and B.

How to Resolve This Conflict? To resolve the ambiguity, we must override the conflicting method in MyClass and explicitly specify which interface's method to call using InterfaceName.super.methodName().

```
class MyClass implements A, B {
    @Override
    public void show() {
        // Explicitly calling interface method
        A.super.show();  // Calls A's default method
        // B.super.show(); // If we want to call B's method instead
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyClass obj = new MyClass();
        obj.show();  // Prints: A's show method
    }
}
```
## @Transactional Annotation in Spring Boot

The @Transactional annotation in Spring Boot is used to manage database transactions. It ensures that a series of database operations are executed as a single unit of workâ€”either all succeed or all fail (rollback in case of an error).

```java
@Transactional(propagation = Propagation.REQUIRES_NEW)
public void someMethod() {
    // Your code here
}
```

## Garbage Collection (GC) in Java
Garbage Collection (GC) in Java is an automatic memory management process that removes unused objects from heap memory to free up space and avoid memory leaks. It is handled by the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) and does not require explicit deallocation of objects.

## How Does Garbage Collection Work?
Objects are allocated in heap memory when created using new.
Garbage Collector identifies unreachable objects (objects with no active references).
GC removes those objects and reclaims memory.
Memory is compacted and optimized to reduce fragmentation.
When Does Garbage Collection Happen?
The JVM runs GC automatically when it detects low memory.
You can suggest GC using System.gc(), but it is not guaranteed to run immediately.
GC primarily occurs during idle CPU time to minimize performance impact.

## How to Make a Class Immutable in Java?
An immutable class is a class whose objects cannot be modified after creation. All fields of an immutable object remain constant throughout its lifecycle.

Steps to Create an Immutable Class in Java
To make a class immutable, follow these best practices:

1. Declare the class as final
This prevents subclassing, which could allow modification of fields.

final class ImmutableClass {
2. Make all fields private and final
Fields should be private to prevent direct access and final to ensure they are assigned only once.

private final int id;
private final String name;
3. Initialize fields via a constructor
Provide a constructor to initialize all fields.

public ImmutableClass(int id, String name) {
    this.id = id;
    this.name = name;
}
4. Do not provide setter methods
Setters allow modification, so they should not be present.

5. Return deep copies of mutable fields in getters
If a field is a mutable object (like a List or Date), return a defensive copy to prevent modification.

public Date getDate() {
    return new Date(date.getTime());  // Defensive copy
}
## ðŸ”¹ Summary Table
Static Feature	Description	Example Usage
1) Static Variable -	Shared by all instances of a class	static int count;
2) Static Method - Belongs to the class, not an instance	static void show();
3) Static Block	- Executes once when the class loads	static { init(); }
4) Static Nested Class	- Does not require an outer class instance	static class Inner {}
5) Static Import - Allows direct use of static members	import static java.lang.Math.*;

## When to Use What?
Use @PathVariable when the value is a key part of the resource path (e.g., /orders/{orderId}).
Use @RequestParam for optional query parameters that refine the request (e.g., /orders?status=shipped).

## Ways to Represent a "Has-a" Relationship in Java:
In object-oriented design, a "has-a" relationship represents composition or aggregation, meaning one class contains an instance (or multiple instances) of another class. This is also known as object association.

# Composition (Strong Association)

If the contained object cannot exist without the container.
Implemented using instance variables.
Example:
```
class Engine {
    void start() {
        System.out.println("Engine started");
    }
}

class Car {
    private Engine engine;  // Strong association (Composition)
    
    public Car() {
        this.engine = new Engine(); // Created inside Car (Car owns Engine)
    }

    void startCar() {
        engine.start();
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car car = new Car();
        car.startCar();  // Engine started
    }
}
```
Here, Car has-a Engine. If Car is destroyed, its Engine is also destroyed.
# Aggregation (Weak Association)

If the contained object can exist independently.
The parent class holds a reference to the child class instead of owning it.
Example:
```
class Engine {
    void start() {
        System.out.println("Engine started");
    }
}

class Car {
    private Engine engine;  // Weak association (Aggregation)
    
    public Car(Engine engine) {  // Injected from outside
        this.engine = engine;
    }

    void startCar() {
        engine.start();
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Engine engine = new Engine();  // Created independently
        Car car = new Car(engine);    // Passed as a dependency
        car.startCar();  // Engine started
    }
}
```
Here, Engine exists independently, and Car just has a reference to it.
# Summary:
Type	Relationship	Object Lifespan
Composition	Strong association	Contained object depends on container
Aggregation	Weak association	Contained object exists independently
